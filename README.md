# Face-Recognition
Detected the seven human face emotions (6 universal+1 neutral) using Convolution Neural Network Model. Built EfficientNetB2 model and trained it over 40,000+ images, resulted in 63%accuracy on the testing dataset. Utilized OpenCV and Dlib to connect the web camera to perform face detection.
